# Alienware AC16250 – Arch Linux Bluetooth Debug Summary

## Hardware

* Laptop: **Alienware AC16250**
* Wireless chip: **MediaTek MT7925**

  * Wi-Fi → PCIe (`mt7925e`) ✅ works
  * Bluetooth → **USB device** ❌ missing

## Current State (confirmed)

* Firmware present:

  * `/usr/lib/firmware/mediatek/mt7925/BT_RAM_CODE_MT7925_1_1_hdr.bin(.zst)`
* Kernel: **6.18.2-arch** (new enough)
* `btusb` driver loads, but:

  * No `/sys/class/bluetooth`
  * `bluetooth.service` skipped (“unmet condition”)
  * `rfkill` shows Wi-Fi only, no Bluetooth
* Conclusion:
  **Bluetooth hardware is not being exposed to Linux at all**

## Root Cause

* Bluetooth power is controlled by the **EC (Embedded Controller)** + BIOS
* EC is currently **not powering the Bluetooth USB device**
* This is **below the OS** (not a driver, firmware, or Arch issue)

## What WILL NOT fix it

* Reinstalling bluez
* Reinstalling firmware
* Changing kernels
* modprobe tricks
* systemd changes

## What TO DO (in order)

### 1. Check BIOS settings (most important)

Enter BIOS/UEFI and ensure:

* **Wireless / Bluetooth: ENABLED**
* Internal wireless devices enabled
* **Fast Boot: DISABLED**

Save and exit.

### 2. EC (Embedded Controller) hard reset

1. Power off laptop
2. Unplug charger
3. Hold power button **20–30 seconds**
4. Wait another 30 seconds
5. Plug charger back in
6. Boot Linux

### 3. After reboot, verify

Run:

```bash
lsusb
```

You should see a **MediaTek Bluetooth device**.

If yes, Bluetooth will then:

* create `/sys/class/bluetooth`
* allow `bluetooth.service` to start
* work normally with BlueZ

### 4. If still missing

* Update BIOS to latest version
* Repeat EC reset after BIOS update

## Key Diagnostic Rule

* **No MediaTek device in `lsusb` = Bluetooth is disabled by firmware**
* Once it appears in `lsusb`, no Arch changes are needed

---

If Bluetooth comes back after reboot/EC reset, **nothing else needs to be configured**.
